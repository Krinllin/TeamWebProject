            <h1>'Halo Infinite' creative head Joseph Staten is leaving Microsoft</h1>
            <h2>"Joseph Staten, one of the creatives most closely associated with the Halo franchise, is leaving Microsoft. 
                News of the departure was first reported on Friday by IGN. 
                “We’re grateful for Joseph’s contributions to the Halo franchise and Xbox as a whole," Microsoft told the outlet. 
                “We wish him all the best in his new adventure.” Staten later confirmed the news that same day. 
                "Hey folks, I am indeed leaving Microsoft,” he said on Twitter. 
                “I'll have more info to share soon, but for now, I'd just like to thank all my Xbox colleagues for all their understanding and support as I embark on a new adventure."
